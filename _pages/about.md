My research focuses primarily on multi-modal semantic mapping for robotics using probability theory and functional analysis. By treating neural network outputs as measurements, I use probability theory and Bayes' Theorem to fuse these measurements together and quantiy the uncertainty of the network outputs across time. I am also interested in leveraging Riemannian geometric priors for learning as reasoning about these Riemanninan embedding spaces for robot task planning.
